                the sky is the wide,open space above us,sretching from horizon to horizon.
                duringtheday,it often appears blue beacause sunlight scatters through the atmosphere.
                clouds drift across it in different shapes something fluffy and white,other timesdark and heavy with rain.
                at sunrise and sunset,the sky glows with brilliant colors like orange,pink,and purple.
                at night it turns deep and dark dotted with stars,planet,and the moon.
                the sky constantly change,making it one of natures not peaceful and inspiring sights.
